      <h2>About Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human-like intelligence, such as problem-solving,
        decision-making, and pattern recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI enhances classroom engagement, personalizes learning, and streamlines administrative processes. For educators, it's essential to understand AI tools and integrate them into learning experiences that support critical thinking and accessibility.
